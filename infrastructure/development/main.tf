# DATABASE ENGINE PORTS
#
# For every ACTIVE engine in database/registry.json:
#
#   - its port is opened on the isolated tier's security group, from each tier
#     whose services may connect to it (the shared fleets' security groups) and
#     from the team's own tools (core's team-tools group, a database GUI), and
#   - its port is published at /<project>/database/engines/<engine>/port, which
#     is where services read it (docs/platform-contract.md in core).
#
# An engine that becomes inactive loses both. Starting and stopping the engines
# themselves is the database host's job (scripts/ci/send-update.sh); this only
# decides who can reach them.
#
# Everything about the environment comes from the platform contract, never from
# core's state.
